Allow users to set their own password during site registration.

== Description ==

This plugin allows users to set their passwords during the registration process. Once activated, a password field will appear on the registration field which uses the same functionality as the password field you get when you're resetting your password.

The email notification sent to the new user is also modified to indicate a successful password set.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/fs-registration-password` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
